## Analysis of the Game
Game state is the 16 numbers on the 4 x 4 board. 

## Work in Progress

- [x] Deep Q Learning
- [ ] Functional approximator for Q function. 
    - [x] Adding BN to Q model  
    - [x] Add exponential activation at the end, add log prerpocessing at the start.
- [x] Implement CNN version of Q network. 
- [x] Apply Q function to policy. 


## Performance Comparison 
Tree search method (Monte Carlo Expectation maximization) with 2 search step and 4 seeds.
